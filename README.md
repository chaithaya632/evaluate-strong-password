# Password Strength Evaluation

* Overview

This project demonstrates the importance of password complexity and explores how different passwords score on an online password strength checker.

The goal is to understand:

What makes a password strong or weak.

How password length and character variety affect security.

Best practices to protect against common password attacks.



*Tools Used

PasswordMeter – online password strength checker

Word Processor (MS Word / Google Docs) – to create report

GitHub – project hosting



* Steps Performed

1. Created multiple test passwords of varying complexity.


2. Evaluated them using PasswordMeter.


3. Collected scores and feedback.


4. Documented results in a structured report.


5. Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).


6. Summarized best practices for strong passwords.




* Sample Results

Password	Complexity Level	Score / Feedback	Notes

hello123	Low	Weak – short, common pattern	Easy to guess
Hello123!	Medium	Fair – better but predictable	Slightly stronger
He!!o_1234	Strong	Good – includes symbols & numbers	Still short
Myp@ssW0rd!2025	Very Strong	Strong – long + variety	Difficult to brute force
Xy#92kLm!Zp8&	Very Strong+	Excellent – high entropy	Hard to crack



* Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Use 12+ characters (longer is stronger).

Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid dictionary words or predictable substitutions.

Consider using passphrases (e.g., random memorable sentences).

Never reuse the same password across accounts.

Use a password manager to store complex passwords safely.



* Common Password Attacks

Brute Force: Trying all possible combinations.

Dictionary Attack: Using common words/phrases.

Credential Stuffing: Using leaked passwords from breaches.

Conclusion

By experimenting with different passwords, this project highlights the importance of complexity, length, and randomness in password security.
Strong passwords greatly reduce the risk of compromise from brute force or dictionary attacks.
